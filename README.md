Introducing my latest project - an AI music curator that generates playlists based on natural language input! Using React.js and TypeScript for the frontend, and Node.js and Express for the backend, I've developed a sleek and intuitive web app that helps users discover new music that fits their mood and preferences.

I came up with the idea for this app after struggling to find music that matched my melancholic mood while studying at university. I wanted to create a tool that would make it easy for others to discover music based on their mood or theme.

Here's how it works: Users simply type an input prompt into the app, and the GPT 3.5 language model through the OpenAI API generates a list of songs that match the user's mood or theme. To play the songs directly in the app, I've integrated both the Spotify Web API and the Spotify Web Playback SDK. Please note that a Spotify premium account is required to use the app.

To enhance the user experience, I've implemented some features such as dynamic song loading and playback, song skipping, and repeat options. I've also designed a modern and user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to browse and select songs.

Overall, this project allowed me to explore the potential of AI in music curation and create a tool that can help others discover new music that fits their mood and preferences. I'm excited to continue developing this app and incorporating new features that make it even more useful and enjoyable for users.

## Here's a quick demo of Hey DJ!
